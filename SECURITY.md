# Security Policy

## Overview

The Homo-Habits framework takes security and privacy extremely seriously. As a system that handles semantic identity data and personal behavioral patterns, we implement multiple layers of security to protect user information.

## Supported Versions

We currently support the following versions with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Architecture

### Ephemeral Identity Model

Our core security is built on the ephemeral identity approach:
- **No stored identity objects**: Identity emerges from real-time observations
- **Ecosystem lock**: Requires both person and machine environment for validation
- **Zero computational overhead**: Security through uniqueness, not encryption

### Privacy Guarantees

- **Differential Privacy**: Îµ = 0.1 guarantee for all data disclosures
- **Selective Disclosure**: Minimum necessary information sharing
- **User Control**: Granular permissions for all data usage

### Technical Security Measures

- **Memory Safety**: Rust prevents buffer overflows and memory corruption
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing prevents many classes of bugs
- **Secure Dependencies**: Regular auditing of all dependencies
- **Encrypted Communications**: TLS 1.3 for all network communications

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Immediate Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do **NOT** create a public GitHub issue. Instead:

1. **Email**: Send details to security@homo-habits.com
2. **Subject Line**: Include "[SECURITY]" in the subject
3. **Content**: Provide as much detail as possible:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development**: Within 1 week for critical issues
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and tested

### Security Bug Bounty

We operate a security bug bounty program:

| Severity | Reward Range |
|----------|-------------|
| Critical | $500 - $2000 |
| High     | $250 - $750  |
| Medium   | $100 - $300  |
| Low      | $50 - $100   |

### What We Consider Security Issues

**High Priority:**
- Authentication bypass
- Privilege escalation
- Remote code execution
- SQL injection
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Data leakage of semantic identity information
- Privacy violations in selective disclosure
- Bypass of ephemeral identity protections

**Medium Priority:**
- Information disclosure
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
- Denial of service (DoS)
- Insecure direct object references

**Low Priority:**
- Rate limiting bypasses
- Minor information disclosure
- Self-XSS with no user interaction

### Out of Scope

- Issues in third-party dependencies (report to them directly)
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security issues
- Denial of service through resource exhaustion
- Issues that require physical access to user devices
- Theoretical attacks without practical exploitation

## Security Best Practices for Developers

### Code Review Requirements

All code changes must:
- Pass automated security scans
- Be reviewed by at least one security-trained developer
- Include security impact assessment for significant changes

### Dependency Management

- Use `cargo audit` for Rust dependencies
- Use `pnpm audit` for Node.js dependencies
- Update dependencies regularly
- Pin specific versions in production

### Secrets Management

- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use secure secret storage in production

### API Security

- Implement rate limiting on all endpoints
- Validate all input parameters
- Use authentication for sensitive operations
- Log security-relevant events

## Privacy Protection Measures

### Data Minimization

- Collect only necessary data
- Process data locally when possible
- Implement automatic data expiration
- Provide user data export and deletion

### Encryption

- Encrypt all data in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use authenticated encryption (AES-GCM)
- Implement proper key management

### Access Controls

- Implement least privilege access
- Use role-based access control (RBAC)
- Log all access to sensitive data
- Implement session management

## Compliance

### Standards Compliance

- **GDPR**: Full compliance for EU users
- **CCPA**: Compliance for California users
- **SOC 2**: Type II compliance
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management

### Regular Audits

- Quarterly security assessments
- Annual penetration testing
- Continuous vulnerability scanning
- Third-party security audits

## Security Tools and Monitoring

### Automated Security

- **Static Analysis**: Clippy with security lints
- **Dependency Scanning**: cargo-audit and npm audit
- **SAST**: SonarQube integration
- **Container Scanning**: Docker image vulnerability scans

### Runtime Security

- **WAF**: Web Application Firewall for API protection
- **IDS/IPS**: Intrusion detection and prevention
- **SIEM**: Security information and event management
- **Log Analysis**: Automated log monitoring for threats

### Security Metrics

We track:
- Time to patch vulnerabilities
- Number of security incidents
- Security training completion rates
- Audit finding resolution times

## Incident Response Plan

### Detection and Analysis
1. Automated alerts trigger incident response
2. Security team assesses severity and impact
3. Incident commander assigned for critical issues

### Containment and Eradication
1. Immediate containment measures
2. Root cause analysis
3. Fix development and testing

### Recovery and Lessons Learned
1. Monitored deployment of fixes
2. Post-incident review
3. Process improvements
4. Public disclosure (if applicable)

## Legal Safe Harbor

We support responsible disclosure and will not pursue legal action against researchers who:
- Make a good faith effort to avoid harm
- Report vulnerabilities responsibly
- Do not access unnecessary data
- Do not perform destructive testing
